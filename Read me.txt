To create a regression model to predict cement compressive strength.

Building a regression model to predict cement compressive strength requires a 
combination of data cleaning and preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm
 selection and training, evaluation, and model improvement. With these steps,
 you can create a robust model that accurately predicts the compressive strength
 of cement mixtures.
